# ‚öΩ Fantasy Football Team Optimizer

C++ implementation of algorithms (Exhaustive Search, Greedy, Metaheuristic) to optimize Fantasy Football team selection based on player statistics, budget constraints, and tactical formations.

## üìå Project Context

Developed for the *Algor√≠smia i Programaci√≥ III* (Algorithms and Programming III) course at **Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)**, this project aims to create a support program for a Fantasy Football game. The core challenge is to select a team that maximizes total points from the previous year's performance, subject to various constraints.

## üèÜ Problem Definition

The goal is to select a Fantasy Football team that maximizes the sum of previous year's player points, adhering to the following rules:

-   **Total Budget:** A maximum total team cost of `T` euros.
-   **Player Cap:** A maximum individual player cost of `J` euros per player.
-   **Formation:** A predefined tactical formation given by $N_1$ defenders, $N_2$ midfielders, and $N_3$ forwards, where $1 \le N_1, N_2, N_3 \le 5$ and $N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 10$.
-   **Goalkeeper:** Exactly one goalkeeper must be selected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Three distinct C++ programs (`exh.cc`, `greedy.cc`, `mh.cc`) are implemented to solve the optimization problem:

### 1. `exh.cc` (Exhaustive Search)

-   Implements a pure exhaustive search algorithm.
-   Continuously overwrites the output file with the best solution found so far, ensuring that even if aborted, the best intermediate solution is preserved.
-   Not combined with greedy or metaheuristic approaches.
-   Execution time limited to 3 minutes.

### 2. `greedy.cc` (Greedy Algorithm)

-   Implements a greedy approach.
-   Designed for speed, aiming for instantaneous execution even on large instances.
-   Not expected to find the optimal solution due to the computational difficulty of the problem.
-   Execution time limited to 5 seconds.

### 3. `mh.cc` (Metaheuristic)

-   Implements a metaheuristic algorithm (excluding Basic Local Search) from those discussed in class.
-   Similar to the exhaustive search, it overwrites the output file with improved solutions as they are found.
-   Execution time limited to 1 minute.
